Our journey has been one of continuous growth, resilience, and commitment to community welfare.</p>
          <p>The story of Prosperidad Square began over three decades ago, when our <b>founder and CEO, Mr. Surendra Kishore Verma</b> a respected advocate and visionaryâ€”recognized the need for accessible, high-quality education in Patna. Driven by a deep commitment to public service and a desire to empower local students, Mr. Verma established the Honours Coaching Institute. This institute was the first of its kind in the region, providing comprehensive resources to meet the varied teaching and learning needs of students. The Honours Coaching Institute quickly gained a reputation for its rigorous academic standards and holistic support, setting a benchmark for educational excellence.</p>
          <p>Today, Prosperidad Square continues to operate with the same founding principles of accessibility, quality, and compassion. We are driven by a mission to uplift, educate, and counsel individuals across diverse backgrounds.
